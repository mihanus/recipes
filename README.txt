This Curry package contains all files that are necessary to compile
the web application generated by Spicey.

IMPORTANT NOTES:

1. Before you compile the generated web application for the first time,
   execute the command

       > make install

   to install all packages required by this application
   (where the executable `cypm` of the Curry Package Manager should
   be in your path).

2. Before you deploy your web application, you should
   define the variable WEBSERVERDIR in the `Makefile` according to
   your desired location.

   Then you can deploy your web application by the command

       > make deploy

The directory structure of this package as follows
(where <MODEL> is the name of your entity-relationship model).

src/Model/
  This directory contains the implementation of the data model, i.e.,
  it contains the Curry module <MODEL>.curry implementing the access
  to the database which are generated from the ER description.
  In addition to the Curry program, this directory also contains
  the Curry file of the original ER description (file `<MODEL>_ERD.curry`),
  the term files of the transformed ER description (`<MODEL>_ERDT.term`),
  and the info file `<MODEL>_SQLCode.info` which is used by
  the Curry preprocessor when SQL queries are embedded in the source
  code.

src/Controller/
  This directory contains the implementation of the various
  controllers that are responsible to react on user interactions.  It
  also contains a module `AuthorizedControllers.curry` that contains the
  authorization rules that should usually be adapted according to the
  customer requirements.

src/View/
  This directory contains the implementation of the views of the
  different entities. These views are called from the corresponding
  controllers.  Moreover, it also contains the module
  `<MODEL>EntitiesToHtml.curry` which contains the code to translate all
  entities into an HTML representation. Usually, this code should be
  adapted according to the customer requirements.

src/Config/
  This directory contains modules to configure the overall access to
  the functionality provided by the system.  For instance, the
  information about the routes, i.e., the URLs supported by the system
  and their mapping to individual controllers, is defined in the
  module `RoutesData.curry`. The module `ControllerMapping.curry` defines
  the actual mapping of controller references to the operations
  implementing the controllers. The module `UserProcesses.curry`
  contains the definition of the processes that can be selected by the
  user.

src/System/
  This directory contains global modules implementing session
  management, authentication, authorization, user processes, etc.

public/
  This directory contains images and style files used by the installed
  system.
